# PyBer_Analysis Challenge

## Our Task
For this assignment, we were tasked with summarizing ride share data by city type and presenting a graphical representation of weekly fare data
by city from January until April of 2019.  Our primary tool was Python, utilizing the Pandas and Matplotlib functions.  A corresponding analysis of the data was also requested by the client.

## Summary Data

Ride and fare data captured are summarized as follows:

There is a clear trend in the data that as you move away from rural settings through suburban to urban, while there is a much higher volume of trips available,
the average fare per trip is signficantly reduced.  It would be interesting to study how much of this decrease is determined by the length of the trip or by the 
supply of drivers available for each setting.

Fare data by week are summarized as follows:

The weekly data show that there is an lull in usage during the first two weeks of a month with a peak during the third or fourth week.  Also, while average fares for rural and suburban settings are much higher than urban, the total rides are much lower.  Finally, although not expressly requested, the rides / driver per setting are as follows:

RIDES / DRIVER
Rural: 1.6
Suburban 1.3
Urban: 0.67

### Recommendations
Given the results presented, we recommend three possible courses of action:

1) Potentially run promotions during the first two weeks of the year to try to smoothe volume throughout the month
2) Review rates in rural and urban settings and potentially reduce to promote high ridership, and
3) Review the number of drivers in the urban setting.  Oversaturation could result in over supply, reduced average fares, and unhappy drivers.
